I believe that knowledge and technology should ideally be in an open source format, where it can be shared, revalidated by third parties, and made available for secondary use.\nOne of the advantages of the open source format is that knowledge and technology can be shared widely. Open source software can be freely used, modified, and redistributed by anyone. This format ensures that knowledge and technology are not monopolized by a few and that more people have access to it.\nIn addition, the open source format allows a large number of people to work together to develop software of higher quality. By participating in open source projects, many people can learn new knowledge and skills, exchange ideas, and create new knowledge and technologies.\nIn addition, the open source format can provide an environment that facilitates the advancement of knowledge and technology. By participating in open source projects, many people can acquire new knowledge and technologies, which can then be used to develop new products and services. In addition, open source technologies can be used to build more efficient social systems.\nAs described above, the open source format is an important means of sharing knowledge and technology and promoting the development of society as a whole. We should continue our efforts to use open source formats to achieve a better society.\nWe operate this website for these ideals and to contribute to the scientific development of mankind.\nFor the sound development of science # As scientists, we pledge to do the following in our research and development.\nPURSUE THE TRUTH: To give top priority to the pursuit of the truth and to conduct research based on accurate data and analysis. Protect integrity: Conduct research free of fraud and deception in our research. In addition, we will respect the work of other researchers and cite their work appropriately. Contribute to society: Contribute to the improvement of people\u0026rsquo;s health and the environment by giving back to society the results of our research. They will also actively participate in efforts beyond their own field of expertise to solve social problems. Support an open research environment: Actively support the sharing of knowledge and data and promote an open research environment. In addition, participate in fair peer review processes to ensure fair evaluation and transparency of research results. Continue self-improvement: Continue self-improvement and constantly incorporate cutting-edge knowledge and techniques. In addition, we will have a critical attitude toward our own research results and always be aware of improvements. Have a sincere and responsible attitude toward science, contribute to society, and hope for the sound development of science.\n","date":"0001年 1月 1日","permalink":"/en/philosophy/","section":"","summary":"Purpose of this site # ddd3hLab is a website established to record and summarize my own research and development of what I, Daisuke Nishihama, am interested in on a daily basis, and to occasionally publish my ramblings.","title":"Welcome to ddd3hLab"}]
